## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses JavaScript’s `Date()` object to fetch current time and date
- `setInterval()` updates the clock every 1000 milliseconds
- Dark/Light mode is implemented using CSS class toggling
- Tick sound is played using the HTML `<audio>` element
- **Double-click event** toggles sound ON/OFF
- Sound restarts from the beginning when re-enabled
- Browser audio restrictions are handled using user interaction
